The goal of this project is to simulate a Command and Control Server with Clients.  
Along the way, I'll try to learn more about how to use sockets, threads, and protocols.    
In the end, it would be interesting to capture the traffic exchanged between the beacon (client) and the Remote using tools like Wireshark.

# Stream-based Protocol (TCP) vs Datagram-based Protocol (UDP)
## TCP :
Tcp is connection-oriented and reliable stream-based protocol.  
It uses a <ins>three-way handshake</ins> for establishing and maintaining a connection.  
Uses <ins>error checking</ins> for a reliable data transmission.  
Data is send as a **Stream of bytes**, no concept of message boundaries.
-> I'll implement my own using this : https://stackoverflow.com/a/3420392 

## UDP :
No need to establish a connection before sending data.  
A Datagram is an independent, self-contained packet with <ins>no concept of session</ins>  
While UDP enforces **explicit message boundaries** there is no guarantee that Datagrams will be delivered in the correct order. 

### Buffer size consideration
From what I've read, it is preferable not to send data larger than 8192 bytes.
The best way to send an image is to split it into multiple smaller packets and then reconstruct the final image.

The header indicating the length is 4 byte (32 bits) = a max 2^32âˆ’1=4,294,967,295 Integer  
A packet sending 1024 bytes can send a max 1024 char with utf-8.
